Check out the youtube link - he explains it quite well.

SOLUTION

  -Check the actual URL, whitch you are pushing to

    git remote -v

   The output should begin with

   "origin  https@..."

  -Changing the "origin" URL from "https://..." to "git@github..." resolves
   the issue of entering the credentials using command

    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git

    TLDR -  HTTPS protocol can't be used with SSH key-based authentication,
            beacuse it's already encrypted.
            Only the GIT protocol can be used with SSH keys, beacuse GIT
            is a plaintext protocol.
